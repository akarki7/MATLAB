# MATLAB

This project was done in matlab and it involves creating and moving spaceships and robots. Spaceships and robots were created using simple geometric shapes in matlab and were moved through continuous transformation matrices. This project has taught me how to create the model for simple movable objects in matlab using concepts of transformation matrices (rotation, translation etc).
